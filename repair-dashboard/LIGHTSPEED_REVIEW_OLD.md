## ⚠️ The ONE Problem: Prices Not Set

### Current Situation:
- **Products created:** ✅ YES (258 repair products)
- **iPhone variants:** ✅ YES (all models from 11 to 16)
- **Repair types:** ✅ YES (Front, Back, Battery, Camera, Others)
- **Prices set:** ❌ NO (only 1 out of 258 has a price!)

### What We Found:
```
iPhone 16 Pro Max / Front: price = $0 ❌
iPhone 16 Pro Max / Back: price = $0 ❌
iPhone 16 Pro Max / Battery: price = $0 ❌
iPhone 16 Plus / Front: price = $549 ✅ (ONLY ONE WITH PRICE!)
iPhone 16 / Battery: price = $0 ❌
iPhone 15 Pro Max / Front: price = $0 ❌
iPhone 15 Plus / Front: price = $0 ❌
```

**The good news:** The ONE price you did set ($549 for iPhone 16 Plus screen) is **spot-on market pricing!**

---

## 💰 What This Means for Your Sales

### Current Sales Pattern:
From your sales analysis, "iPhone Repair" has **59 sales @ $121.80 average**.

**What's happening:**
1. Staff selects a specific repair variant (e.g., "iPhone 16 Pro Max / Front")
2. Product price = $0 in Lightspeed
3. Staff manually enters the price at checkout ($121.80 avg)
4. Sale completes, but pricing data isn't stored in product catalog

**Why $121.80 average is LOW:**
If you're doing:
- iPhone 16 screens → Should be $450-$550 (you have ONE at $549 ✅)
- iPhone 15 screens → Should be $340-$380
- iPhone 14 screens → Should be $280-$320
- Batteries → Should be $90-$150

Your current **$121.80 average** suggests you're either:
- Charging too little for newer iPhones
- OR doing mostly older models (11/XR) and batteries

## 📊 Revised Revenue Projections

### If You Set Proper Prices:

**Current (Manual Pricing):**
- 59 repairs @ $121.80 avg = **$7,186**

**After Setting Prices (Based on Your Mix):**

Assuming your 59 repairs break down as:
- 20 × iPhone 14/15/16 screens @ $400 avg = $8,000
- 15 × iPhone 11/12/13 screens @ $220 avg = $3,300
- 10 × Battery replacements @ $100 avg = $1,000
- 8 × Back glass @ $200 avg = $1,600
- 6 × Camera/Other repairs @ $180 avg = $1,080

**Total: $14,980** (vs current $7,186)

**Potential increase: +$7,794 (+108%)**
